# PlayOnSeasonPass

As there's no officially announced release date for Season Pass auto-recording of shows in PlayOn.TV / PlayLater.TV -- see one such feature request here: https://support.playon.tv/entries/20676453-auto-recording -- I've decided to start writing a PHP script to do just that.

User Stories (initial list): 
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want a script/program to store a list of shows I like -- so that I can identify which shows I want the script/program to order PlayLater to record when new episodes become available on PlayLater
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want that script/program to send record commands to PlayLater when a new episode is published by PlayLater -- so that those new episodes are recorded
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want that script/program to check for new episodes daily -- so that I don't miss anything new
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want to specify to the script/program the minimum length episode to record -- so that I can record both clips and full episodes if I'd like, or I can just record full episodes
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want the script/program to send me an email whenever a record command is issued (if I choose to receive such emails) -- so that I can know that the script/program is doing its job
- As a PlayLater user/owner, I want the script/program to send me an email whenever it scans the list of episodes for my list of shows I like (if I choose to receive such emails) -- so that I can know that the script/program is doing its job

A brief overview of PlayOn / PlayLater:

PlayOn ( http://www.PlayOn.tv ) is a WIndows-based program which allows people to stream movies and shows to devices such as Rokus, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, etc.  For instance, one way I can use PlayOn is as a proxy / intermediary to watch the latest episodes of the The Big Bang Theoryâ€‹; PlayOn captures episodes posted on CBS.com (plus any commercials that CBS interleaves within the broadcast) and then converts the episodes/commercials into a format which I can watch through my Roku.

PlayLater ( http://www.PlayLater.tv ) is an extension to PlayOn.  Through PlayLater, I can record anything that I can watch on PlayOn.  It is through these two programs that I've been able to "cut the cord" and not have to pay for a monthly television bill anymore.  My only related monthly bill is for cable Internet.
